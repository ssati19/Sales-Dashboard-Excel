An Excel dashboard is a visual representation of data that allows users to monitor, analyze, and track key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics in a concise and interactive manner. It typically consists of multiple charts, graphs, tables, and other visual elements, all combined on a single sheet or across multiple sheets, to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

Key characteristics of an Excel dashboard include:

Data Visualization: Dashboards use various types of charts and graphs, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to present data visually. These visual representations make it easier for users to grasp patterns, trends, and insights from the data

Interactivity: Excel dashboards often incorporate interactive elements like drop-down menus, slicers, or buttons that allow users to filter and manipulate the data dynamically. This interactivity enhances the user experience and enables users to explore the data in more depth.

Real-Time or Automated Data Updates: Depending on the setup, Excel dashboards can be designed to update data automatically from external sources, databases, or other Excel files. This ensures that the information displayed is always current and relevant.
